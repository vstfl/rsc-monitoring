# Test Strategy Evaluation and Recommendations

## Current Test Suite Analysis (`src/__tests__/interactions.test.js`)

*   **Nature:** Primarily unit tests due to extensive mocking of dependencies (Mapbox GL, Firebase, interpolation, UI functions, DOM).
*   **Coverage:** Tests isolated logic related to:
    *   Conditional calling of a mocked `filterStudyArea` based on `studyAreaState`.
    *   RWIS image URL toggling (using logic duplicated within the test file).
*   **Effectiveness:** Low. Provides minimal confidence in the integrated functionality of the application. Does not test actual interactions between modules or rendering.
*   **Maintainability:** Potentially brittle due to heavy reliance on mocks.

## Identified Gaps

Significant parts of the application currently lack automated tests:

1.  **Core Map Interactions (`mapInteractions.js`):** Map initialization, data layer updates, event handling (clicks, hovers).
2.  **Core Web Interactions (`webInteractions.js`):** UI initialization, event listener functionality, dynamic UI updates.
3.  **Data Processing (`interpolation.js`):** Correctness and edge cases for filtering and interpolation algorithms.
4.  **Charting (`charts.js`):** Chart generation and updates.
5.  **Backend Interaction (`firebaseHandler.js`):** Logic surrounding authentication and data fetching/parsing.
6.  **State Management (`stateManager.js`):** Verification of state transitions and access.
7.  **Integration & E2E:** No tests covering cross-module workflows or simulating end-to-end user scenarios.

## Recommendations

1.  **Refactor Existing Tests:**
    *   Reduce mocking in `interactions.test.js` where feasible.
    *   Ensure tests call and verify the *actual* functions from the source code, not re-implemented logic.
2.  **Implement Unit Tests:**
    *   Add focused unit tests for complex, pure functions, especially within `interpolation.js`.
    *   Add unit tests for `stateManager.js`.
    *   Add unit tests for `firebaseHandler.js` (mocking Firebase SDK calls, but testing the handler logic).
3.  **Implement Integration Tests:**
    *   Create new integration tests focusing on the collaboration between key modules:
        *   `mapInteractions` <-> `stateManager` <-> `webInteractions`
        *   `firebaseHandler` -> `stateManager` -> `mapInteractions`/`webInteractions`
        *   Test component rendering based on state changes (might require a testing library integrated with the UI framework/DOM environment, e.g., Testing Library).
4.  **Consider End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   For critical user flows (e.g., login, loading data, map interaction, viewing details), implement E2E tests using frameworks like Cypress or Playwright. This provides the highest level of confidence but requires more setup.
5.  **Testing Strategy:** Define a clear strategy outlining what types of tests (unit, integration, E2E) should cover which parts of the application to ensure balanced and effective coverage.
