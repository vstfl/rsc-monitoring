## Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1.1: Analyze Circular Dependencies

- Identified circular dependencies between `webInteractions.js` and `mapInteractions.js`
- Created state management solution in `src/core/stateManager.js`
- Documented shared state and event communication patterns

### Task 1.1.2: Refactor webInteractions.js

- Removed direct imports from mapInteractions.js
- Implemented state manager for shared state
- Updated event handlers to use state manager
- Added proper null checks for map instance

### Task 1.1.4: Create State Manager

- Implemented pub/sub pattern
- Created centralized state management
- Added proper state initialization
- Implemented state update notifications

## Current Sprint Focus

### Resolving Circular Dependencies

1. Completed:

   - Created state manager module (`src/core/stateManager.js`)
   - Refactored `webInteractions.js` to use state manager

2. Next steps:
   - Refactor `mapInteractions.js` to use state manager
   - Update imports and exports in both files
   - Test the new communication pattern
   - Add error handling for state updates
